The project helps automate various agricultural processes like irrigation, fertigation, humidity control, 
temperature control and day-night control within a greenhouse. The system has been developed taking 
into consideration the requirements of Chrysanthemum plant. 
Climatic conditions in Goa are not conducive to the growth of this plant all round the year. Thus, an
 artificial environment is created that facilitates its growth. The automated irrigation system consists 
of soil moisture sensors which monitor the soil moisture and notify the microcontroller to activate the 
solenoid and irrigate the plants using drip pipes. Humidity control and temperature control is achieved 
using humidity and temperature sensors respectively. Fertigation system is automated through the use 
of software timers. Day-night control system manipulates the length of the day and night in accordance 
with the plant requirements. Finally, an application will keep the farmer informed about the proceedings in the farm. 
The entire project was conducted under the Directorate of Agriculture, Panjim-Goa.
